"""
Implements the 'Watermelon Division' algorithm as described below:

Eric and his friend Cartman decided to buy a watermelon. The watermelon weighs n kilos. Both Eric and Cartman are fans of
even numbers and therefore, they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each part weighs an even number of
kilos. It is not mandatory for the parts to be equal. Each of them should get a part of positive weight.

This function determines if the watermelon can be divided in the way Eric and Cartman want.

Parameters:
n : int
An integer representing the weight of the watermelon in kilos.
Constraints: 1 â‰¤ w â‰¤ 100

Returns:
bool
True if the watermelon can be divided into two parts, each part having an even weight, and False otherwise.

Example:
watermelon(8)
True

watermelon(5)
False

Note:
If the watermelon weight is even and greater than 2, it can be divided into two even parts.
